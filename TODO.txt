- OF writer  
    - nMoles 1; entry may be unnexessary nowadays
   
- correct_coeffs() function could be tidied up by using nasa-functions.

- add readme entry about output, dir creation and log.txt

- lisää __author__ setup.py

- Tcommon not required to be within the fit --> simplifies the setup

- write to README that if you want plots for all, set tolerances to minimum 1e-30

- maybe add plot commands whenever fit fails --> then it's easy to visualise what's the issue.


- bashrc example export print out

- think licensing through

- consider creating TransportData, TransportFit etc data classes to structure the modules
    - enables you to avoid use of tuples as function arguments in utilities
    - Downside is that you would need to use lists for including these classes per specie 
        --> prevents use of many 2d compatible functions (not really required at the moment though)
    - example:
        from dataclasses import dataclass
        @dataclass
        class TransportFit:
            '''Class for keeping track of transport dit data for easier use in the following functions'''
            name: str
            As: float
            Ts: int = 0

- lsqlin author acknowledgement to README

- add readme that fitter class is made general so no cantera based data could be fitted as well.

- Add to readme that efficiency could be enhanced by optimizing for loops to vectorized operations.

- You could avoid calling Tc_i in fitting functions. 
    - There should be no need to include Tcommon twice in the matrix equation as it is done at the moment
