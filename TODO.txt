
- make test to ensure that fitting is valid

- write to output files that they are originating from XX mechanism, made by this tool at this date

- transport plot
- check that Euken cv values are correct or if you'd get rid of cv_mass cv_mole

- mixture cp ct_cpropseis ei toimi nyt

- create OF writer

- make warnings red 

- check the correct way to divide by number and then make it to the power

- correct_coeffs() function could be tidied up by using nasa-functions.

- lisää __author__ setup.py

- Tcommon not required to be within the fit --> simplifies

- fix variable naming

- fix indentation and style

- init-dirs on nyt ct_propertiesin alla

- bashrc example export print out

- think licensing through

- lsqlin author acknowledgement to README

- ADd to readme that efficiency could be enhanced by optimizing for loops to vectorized operations.

- You could avoid calling Tc_i in fitting functions. 
    - There should be no need to include Tcommon twice in the matrix equation as it is done at the moment
