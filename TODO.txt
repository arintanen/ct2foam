- ctmixfoam could be cleaner

- create OF writer  
    - remember that polynomial must be flipped
    - write to output files that they are originating from XX mechanism, made by this tool at this date

- correct_coeffs() function could be tidied up by using nasa-functions.

- lisää __author__ setup.py

- Tcommon not required to be within the fit --> simplifies

- write to README that if you want plots for all, set tolerances to minimum 1e-30

- maybe add plot commands whenever fit fails --> then it's easy to visualise what's the issue.

- fix variable naming

- bashrc example export print out

- think licensing through

- lsqlin author acknowledgement to README

- ADd to readme that efficiency could be enhanced by optimizing for loops to vectorized operations.

- You could avoid calling Tc_i in fitting functions. 
    - There should be no need to include Tcommon twice in the matrix equation as it is done at the moment
